This research project uses historical data (Global Terrorism Database) of terrorist attacks that took place around the world between 1970 to 2016 and aims to make sense of observed patterns by translating it into actionable intelligence. The research is split into three distinct categories in order to evaluate cases of over 170,000 terrorist attacks. The first part is exploratory data analysis which is intended to examine patterns in terrorist attacks from various perspectives and with statistical analysis. Based on the analysis and findings from first exploratory data anaylysis, the next parts in this research makes use of machine learning algorithms to derive actionable insights. An observation from previous research in this field suggests that forecasting methods and classification models were mostly applied on the world level and on yearly data however little/no research is available to forecast future attacks or fatalities based on seasonal patterns (i.e. monthly and quarterly) and on country level. As an extension to existing research, in the second part, this research makes use of time series forecasting models to predict the future attacks and fatalities on micro level by establishing methodology to prepare and evaluate seasonal components from data. Similarly in the classification modelling part, previous research lacks use of cutting edge algorithms that are recently developed and that (practically) out performs traditional algorithms such as random forest, native gbm or xgboost. In the next part of this research, cutting edge gradient boosting algorithm i.e. LightGBM is used to predict the class probability of an attack. In other words, the model is trained on historical data, evaluated on validation data and then used to predict class probability on test data. The important insights from this part is to find causal variables for a particular attack for chosen target variable such as whether or not an attack will be a suicide attack, extended attack, successful attack, part multiple attacks or classifying political-economical-social-religious goal behind the attack. Apart from causal variables, this reasearch also makes use of model explainer to justify reason behind each prediction/decision from the trained algorithm. In line with this scientific research, a shiny app is developed to make this reproducible research interactive and handy. This app is in fact the vital part of this reasearch and is intended to provide interactive platform for all three parts of this reasearch project (i.e. exploratory data analysis, time-series forecasting and classification models) for target audience.
