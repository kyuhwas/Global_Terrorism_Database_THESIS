abstract: |

  In recent years, terrorism has taken a whole new dimension and becoming a global issue because of wide spread attacks and comparatively high number of fatalities. Understanding the attack characteristics of most active groups and subsequent statistical analysis is therefore an important aspect toward counter terrorism support in present situation. In this thesis, we use variety of data mining techniques and descriptive analysis  to determine, examine and characterize threat level from top ten most active and violent terrorist groups and then use machine learning algorithms to avail intelligence toward counterterrorism support. We use historical data of terrorist attacks that took place around the world between 1970 to 2016 from the open-source [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/about/) and the primary objective is to translate terror incident related information into actionable intelligence. In other words, we chase the trajectory of terrorism in present context with statistical methods and derive insights that can be useful. \par

  Major part of this thesis is based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. We use Apriori algorithm to discover patterns in various groups. From the discovered patterns, one of the interesting pattern we find is that ISIL is more likely to attack other terrorists (non-state militia) with bombing/explosion while having resulting fatalities between 6 to 10 where as Boko Haram is more likely to target civilians with explosives, without suicide attack and resulting fatalities more than 50. Within supervised machine learning context, we extend the previous research in time-series forecasting and make use of TBATS, ETS, Auto Arima and Neural Network model. We predict the future number of attacks in Afghanistan and SAHEL region, and number of fatalities in Iraq at monthly frequency. From time-series forecasting, we prove two things; the model that works best in one time-series data may not be the best in another time-series data, and that the use of ensemble significantly improves forecasting accuracy from base models. Similarly in the classification modelling part, previous research lacks use of algorithms that are recently developed. We also extend the previous research in binary classification problem and make use of cutting-edge LightGBM algorithm to predict the probability of suicide attack. Our model achieves 96% accuracy in terms of auc and correctly classifies “Yes” instances of suicide attacks with 86.5% accuracy.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Today, we live in the world where terrorism is becoming a primary concern because of the growing number of terrorist incidents involving civilian fatalities and infrastructure damages. The ideology and intentions behind such attacks is indeed a matter of worry. Living under the constant threat of terrorist attacks in any place is no better than living in jungle and worrying about which animal will attack you and when. An increase in number of radicalized attacks around the world is a clear indication that terrorism transitioning to from a place to an idea however existence of specific terror group and their attack characteristics over the period of time can be vital to fight terrorism and to engage peace keeping missions effectively. Having said that number terrorist incidents are growing these days, availability of open-source data containing information of such incidents, recent developments in machine learning algorithms and technical infrastructure to handle large amount of data open ups variety of ways to turn information into actionable intelligence. 

## Definition of Terrorism {.unnumbered}

Terrorism in broader sense includes state sponsored and non-state sponsored terrorist activities. Scope of this research is limited to **non-state sponsored** terrorist activities only. Non-state actors in simple words mean entities that are not affiliated, directed or funded by the government and that exercise significant economic, political or social power and influence at a national and international level up to certain extent [@NIC_2007]. An example of non-state actors can be NGOs, religious organizations, multinational companies, armed groups or even a online (Internet) community. ISIL is the prime example of non-state actor which falls under armed groups segment. 

> Global Terrorism Database [@NationalConsortiumfortheStudyofTerrorismandResponsestoTerrorismSTART_2016] defines terrorist attack as a threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious or social goal through fear, coercion or intimidation. 

This implies that three of the following attributes are always present in each events of our chosen dataset:

* The incident must be intentional – the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator.
* The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence including property violence, as well as violence against people.
* The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. 

## Problem statement {.unnumbered}

Nowadays, data is considered as the most valuable resource and machine learning makes it possible to interpret complex data however most use cases are seen in business context such as music recommendation, predicting customer churn or finding probability of having cancer. With recent development in machine learning algorithms and access to open source data and software, there are plenty of opportunities to correctly understand historical terrorist attacks and prevent the future conflicts. In the last decade, terrorist attacks have been incresed significantly (data source: GTD) as shown in the plot below: 


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Terrorist attacks around the world between 1970-2016", fig.height=3, out.width = "100%"}

tmp <- df %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(attack_count = n())
img <- png::readPNG("figure/terrorism_logo1.png") 
rast <- grid::rasterGrob(img, interpolate = T)

ggplot(tmp, aes(x=year, y=attack_count)) + 
  expand_limits(y = c(1, 18000)) +
  annotation_custom(rast, ymin = 5000, ymax = 15000, xmin = 2007) +
  geom_line(size=1.2, color="red") + 
  ggtitle("Terrorist attacks around the world between 1970-2016") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= seq(1970, 2016, 5)) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size=12), plot.title = element_text(size=12)) 

```

After September 2001 attacks, USA and other powerful nations have carried out major operations to neutralize the power and spread of known and most violent terrorist groups within targeted region such as in Afghanistan, Iraq and most recently in Syria. It’s also worth mentioning that United Nations already have ongoing peacekeeping missions in conflicted regions around the world for a long time. However number of terror attacks continues to rise and in fact, it is almost on peak in the last 5 years. This leads to a question why terrorism is becoming unstoppable despite the continued efforts. Understanding and interpreting the attack characteristics of relevant groups in line with their motivations to do so can reflect bigger picture. An extensive research by [@Heger_2010] supports this argument and suggests that a group’s political intentions are revealed when we examine who or what it chooses to attack.

## Research design and data {.unnumbered}

This research employs mix of qualitative and quantitative research methodology to achieve the set objective. In total, we evaluate cases of over 170,000 terrorist attacks. We start with exploratory data analysis to assess the impact on global scale and then use variety of data mining techniques to determine the most active and violent terrorist groups. This way, we ensure that the analysis reflects the situation in present years. We use descriptive statistics to understand characteristics of each group over the period of time and locate the major and minor epicentres (most vulnerable regions) based on threat level. To examine whether or not chosen groups have common link with number of fatalities, we perform statistical hypothesis test with ANOVA and PostHoc test. 

The research then makes use of variety of machine learning algorithms with supervised and unsupervised technique. 

> According to [@Samuel_1959], A well-known researcher in the field of artificial intelligence who coined the term "machine learning", defines machine learning as a “field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. It is subset of artificial intelligence which enables computers to learn from experience in order to create inference over a possible outcome used later to take a decision. 

With Apriori algorithm, we discover interesting patterns through association rules for individual groups. This way, we can pinpoint the habits of specific groups. Next, we perform time-series analysis to examine seasonal patterns and correlations. To address the broad question “when and where”, we use four time-series forecasting models namely Auto Arima, Neural Network, TBATS and ETS to predict future number of attacks and fatalities. We evaluate and compare the performance of each model on hold out set and use ensemble approach to further improve the accuracy of predictions. As illustrated in [Literature review] section, most research in time-series forecasting addresses the country and year level predictions. We extend the previous research in this field with seasonality component and make forecasts on monthly frequency. Similarly, in the classification modelling part, previous research lacks use of algorithms that are recently developed and that (practically) out perform traditional algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests etc. We extend the previous research in binary classification context and make use of cutting-edge LightGBM algorithm to predict the class probability of an attack involving suicide attempt. We illustrate the importance of feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization for modelling process and describe the reasons why standard validation techniques such as cross-validation would be a bad choice for this data. We propose an alternate strategy for validation and use AUC metric as well as confusion matrix to evaluate model performance on unseen data. From the trained model, we extract the most important features and use explainer object to further investigate decision making process behind our model. The scope of analysis can be further extended with shiny app which is also an integral part to make this research handy and interactive. 

**Data**

This research project uses historical data of terrorist attacks that took place around the world between 1970 to 2016 from open-source [Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/about/) as a main source of data. It is currently the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist events in the world and contains information on over 170,000 terrorist attacks. It contains information on the date and location of the incident, the weapons used and nature of the target, the number of casualties and the group or individual responsible if identifiable. Total number of variables is more than 120 in this data. One of the main reason for choosing this database is because 4,000,000 news articles and 25,000 news sources were reviewed to prepare this data from 1998 to 2016 alone [@NationalConsortiumfortheStudyofTerrorismandResponsestoTerrorismSTART_2016].

Main data is further enriched with country and year wise socio-economical conditions, arms import/export details and migration details from World Bank Open Data to get multi-dimensional view for some specific analysis. This additional data falls under the category of early warning indicators (short term and long term) and potentially linked to the likelihood of violent conflicts as suggested by the researcher [@Walton_2011] and [@StockholmInternationalPeaceResearchInstitute_2017].

An important aspect of this research is use of open-source data and open-source software i.e. R. The reason why media-based data source is chosen as primary source of data is because journalists are usually the first to report and document such incidents and in this regard, first hand information plays significant role in quantitative analysis. Since the source of data is from publically available sources, the term "intelligence" refers to open-source intelligence (OSINT) category. Intelligence categories are further explained in the next chapter.


## Policy and practice implications {.unnumbered}

This research project is an endeavour to achieve actionable intelligence using machine learning approach and contributes positively to the counter terrorism policy. Outcome of this research provides descriptive findings about most lethal groups, corresponding pattern discovery through Apriori algorithm and predictive analysis through time-series forecasting and classification algorithm. Research findings and insights will be helpful to policy makers or authorities to take necessary steps in time to prevent future terrorist incidents. 

To ensure that the research claims are (easily) reproducible, this thesis uses rmarkdown and bookdown package which allows code execution in line with written report. In addition, a shiny app in R is developed to make the practical aspects of this research handy, interactive and easily accessible. This app also allows to further extend the scope of analysis. All the scripts will be publicly accessible on my github profile^[https://github.com/pranavpandya84] after submission.
